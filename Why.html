	<p>Why of all place would I go to New York City. Well ever since I heard of the
	 city I always wanted to visit. When I was four years old I imagined the idea 
	 of tall skyscrapers that reached towards the stars and bridges that lead to 
	 another place. I always wandered what it'll feel like going to school and working in
	 such a big city, but my mom said that I was better off living in california than 
	 any other state. I kinda believed her, but I never left the idea of trying 
	 something new.</p>
